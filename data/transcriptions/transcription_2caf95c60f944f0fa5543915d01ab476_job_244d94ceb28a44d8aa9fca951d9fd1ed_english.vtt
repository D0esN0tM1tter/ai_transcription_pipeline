In mathematics the parallel sides are called base, this is base and this is base.

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:15.240
Why did I write big and girl? Because this is called a minor base and this is called a major base.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:23.399
I come to my drawing, you see that this would be the largest base and you see that this would be the smallest base of the trapeze.

00:00:23.399 --> 00:00:29.399
and this would be the largest base and this would be the lowest base.

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:34.200
So, and he gave me a rectabule that I guess everyone knows what it's doing by height.
